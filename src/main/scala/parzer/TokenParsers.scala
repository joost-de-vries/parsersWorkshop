  /*  Consider expressions built up from non-negative numbers, greater or equal to zero using a
  subtraction operator that associates to the left.

A possible grammar for such expressions would look as follows:
expr ::= expr - nat | nat
nat ::= 0 | 1 | 2 ...

However, this grammar is left-recursive and hence directly transliterating this grammar into parser combinators would
result in a program that does not terminate because of the left-recursion.
You can factor recursive grammars using iteration.

Choose an iterative implementation of left-asociative expressions that does not suffer from non-termination. */
